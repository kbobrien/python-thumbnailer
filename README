Overview
--------

This is a simple WSGI Python module to implement and image thumbnailer including a caching layer for serious performance. 


Setup
-----

There are several other web server options available for WSGI application.  A great benchmarking/configuration artical is available here to help you make a decision on which one to go with: http://nichol.as/benchmark-of-python-web-servers

I've gone with Apache2 and mod_wsgi and memcached based on it's simplicity, easy installation on Ubuntu and decent performance results. I've also added Memcached to speed things up a little.  An simple Apache Bench test showed me that with memcached enabled I got 500.45 TPS compared to 11.92 TPS without the cache. 


Installation on Ubuntu
----------------------

On Ubuntu I installed the following packages:

sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-wsgi
sudo apt-get install memcached
sudo apt-get install python-memcache


To register your new WSGI application with Apache you need to make the following entry in your httpd.conf

$ sudo vi /etc/apache2/httpd.conf

And add the uri path and location of your script like so:

WSGIScriptAlias /thumbnail /home/kobrien/projects/github/python-thumbnailer/thumbnail.py
